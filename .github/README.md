# PredictThat

PredictThat is an app that allows users to place bets with fake money on real-world outcomes. Elements of this site are borrowed from [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/), [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/), and [PredictIt](https://www.predictit.org/).

Currently, users are able to:

 - Create, Modify, Delete, and Resolve Markets
 - Buy and sell shares

Every new account begins with $1000 in fake money.

# Future Features

## Add odds slider (metaculus-like) to simplify trades

## Implement websockets
## Add user reviews

## Search

If a user would like to search for specific markets, there will be a searchbar at the top of the page which will allow them to enter queries, returning any markets that have the queries within the title and search description.

## Positions

A user will be able to view their current holdings in each respective market, closed or open. Each market will show the total and % loss and return for each market, and the top of the page will show overall gains and losses.
