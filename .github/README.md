# PredictThat

PredictThat is an app that allows users to place bets with fake money on real-world outcomes. Elements of this site are borrowed from [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/), [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/), and [PredictIt](https://www.predictit.org/).

Currently, users are able to:

 - Create, Modify, Delete, and Resolve Markets
 - Buy and sell shares

Every new account begins with $1000 in fake money.
